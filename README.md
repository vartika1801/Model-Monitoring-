# Model Monitoring with Evidently | Drift Detection Dashboard

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to monitor **machine learning model performance over time** using [Evidently AI](https://github.com/evidentlyai/evidently). It focuses on detecting **data drift**, **target drift**, and generating visual dashboards to help data scientists and ML engineers evaluate whether their model's input data or predictions have changed in production.

## Features

- Detect **data drift** (input feature distribution change)
- Monitor **target drift** (label distribution shift)
- Analyze **data quality** issues
- Automatically generate interactive **HTML reports**
- Built using **Evidently 0.4.17** for full compatibility and stable outputs
